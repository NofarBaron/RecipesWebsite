In this project we build the Back part of the recipe website that we will create.\
First, we created our database in **mysql**. The database helps us maintain the entire system, as well as the possibility of creating personal, family recipes, saving users.\
Under the **routers** folder appear the various modules we used to build the system.\
Also, we used the service of an external api - https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs to search over recipe, fetching general information about the recipe.
